                If your group or charity is planning a fundraiser or festival and is serving a meal, we can help you with the meat. We have helped other groups to maximize their food budgets while wowing their donars.

                We can help you cost effectly secure the meat, produce the cuts or special products. Common requests from these groups are to cut steaks or produce the fresh link sausage for them to cook during the event. All meat USDA inspected and certifide.

                If your group is planning an event, as you well know, buying retail meat from a grocery store can stress your food budget. Through working with our supplier contacts and by using our experience for possible options and purchase timing, we can help to keep the meat portion of your food budget under control.
