                CTP began as a wildgame processor in 2017 and quickly expanded operations to become a State inspected and licensed  custom livestock processing facility. Our goal is to produce products of the highest quality and be completely transparent with our pricing. There are no hidden charges and if you would like an estimate of the cost, we are completely willing to give you an estimate that should be very close to the actual final price. We have always held the belief that fair for you and fair for us is the right way to do business.
            </p>

                We are happy to work with you on filling out your cut card to maximize what you are getting from your animal. Every cut decision is a give and take on other cuts and we will gladly work with you to understand this give and take. Finishing livestock before processing is as, if not more, important than the breed of the animal. A proper and affective finishing routine, especially for cattle, determines the grade and hence the tenderness and texture of the cuts. If you have decided to process, but are unsure how to finish the animal, give us a call and we can help you come up with a finishing routine.
