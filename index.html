  <p class="pindex">
    CTP began as a wildgame processor in 2017 and quickly expanded operations to become a State inspected and licensed  custom livestock processing facility. Our goal is to produce products of the highest quality and be completely transparent with our pricing. There are no hidden charges and if you would like an estimate of the cost, we are completely willing to give you an estimate that should be very close to the actual final price. We have always held the belief that fair for you and fair for us is the right way to do business.
</p>
<p class="pindex">
    We are happy to work with you on filling out your cut card to maximize what you are getting from your animal. Every cut decision is a give and take on other cuts and we will gladly work with you to understand this give and take. Finishing livestock before processing is as, if not more, important than the breed of the animal. A proper and affective finishing routine, especially for cattle, determines the grade and hence the tenderness and texture of the cuts. If you have decided to process, but are unsure how to finish the animal, give us a call and we can help you come up with a finishing routine.
</p>
<p class="pindex">
    Our product recipes are tried and true tested. Our link sausage recipe is a family German sausage recipe that has been traced back to the 1880's. If have your own recipe and would like us to make your product with that recipes just let us know and we are happy to accomidate your request when making your product.

          Unlike many other wildgame processors, CTP does not batch process your meat. Batch processing means your meat and everyone elses meat gets mixed together and you are given back your weight portion. This means that if another hunter does not properly care for his animal, then you may end up with some of that meat. When you bring us an animal for processing, it is tracked and segregated from the time it enters the facility until you come pick up the package product. You can rest assured that what you brought us you are getting only that back.

          We can help you cost effectly secure the meat, produce the cuts or special products. Common requests from these groups are to cut steaks or produce the fresh link sausage for them to cook during the event. All meat USDA inspected and certifide.

          If your group is planning an event, as you well know, buying retail meat from a grocery store can stress your food budget. Through working with our supplier contacts and by using our experience for possible options and purchase timing, we can help to keep the meat portion of your food budget under control.
